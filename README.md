# Dog Behavior Framework
A structured framework for trust-based off-leash dog training and emotional behaviour work.  
Developed by Sebastian Stroeller, founder of Zoeta Dogsoul in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

This non-coding repo outlines the foundational concepts and phases of emotional training based on:

- Connection instead of correction
- Leadership through clarity and emotion
- Recall without force
- Canine-human communication
